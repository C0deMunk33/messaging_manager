Notes:
OK:
- Slack API would work with proper app permissions
- Telegram: Client API would work, requires you do a phone auth at runtime?
- Gmail
- outlook

Not OK:
- Discord: No personal DMs, can be bot and scrape rooms its in, can send/recieve DMs as own bot
- insta: API is only for business accounts, DMs are not accessable

Maybe: 
- X: needs elevated access, permissions, and very limited/expensive
